Welcome to my personal corner of the internet where I share insights into my life—my thoughts, current projects, aspirations, and more.

*Like life itself, this website is forever a work in progress.*

### Technology
This website's all the content is written and rendering is in markdown and generated using a static website generator that I built myself using a few other technologies. 
(Also going to launch a blog post on how I built this website, and separate the generator as a packaged template)

Why? I simply love working simple site with complex yet simple working. It was also a fun challenge for me to build my own static website generator.

Updates to the website, including new articles and other content, are pushed to the website’s public GitHub repository at [github.com/nikhiltidke101/nktd.dev](https://github.com/nikhiltidke101/nktd.dev).

I buy all my domain names at Porkbun. I bought nktd.me in 2022.

I like to know how people find my website, so I use Plausible for anonymous analytics and check the referral sources once in a while.

### Carbon footprint
Thanks to this being a static website, only 0.0026g CO² is produced per visit, according to [websitecarbon.com](https://www.websitecarbon.com/).

The global average is 300 times more at around 0.8g CO² per visit.
