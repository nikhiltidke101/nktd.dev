### Work 
I'm currently working as a design engineer at [devrev](https://devrev.ai), where I'm developing interfaces for the website and devrev app.

### Reworking this website
I just finished redoing this website. I'm trying to make it generated using a custom markdown static website generator. Everything from design to content to hosting is also quite a bit simpler. I love simple things.

### Phasing out social media
I’ve felt distracted by social media lately. I want to figure out a way to move all my online interactions to email (because I love email). I’m just not sure yet how to do this without losing the ability to meet new people online.

### Spending less time in front of the computer
Now that summer is here, I would like to spend more time outside and away from the computer again. I try to stick to at least one computer-free day every weekend, but it’s easier said than done.

### Other
- Outside of software development, I've been buliding a few things in workshop, I'm currently working on a small wooden table.
I've plan of adding a new tools page to this site with some of my favourite tools.
- Also learning to play [harmonica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica), it's a fun instrument to play.
- I'm also reading [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow) by Daniel Kahneman. 
It's a great book on psychology and decision-making.
