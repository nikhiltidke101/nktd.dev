Hi, I’m __Nikhil__, popularly [@nikhillst](https://twitter.com/nikhillst) on the internet. 

I have a penchant for reading literature on science and tech, financial diplomacy, and warfare. 
I’m also a huge fan of the works of [*Carl Sagan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan), [*Richard Feynman*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman "Richard Feynman"), [*Nassim Nicholas Taleb*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb "Nassim Nicholas Taleb"), [*Yuval Noah Harari*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuval_Noah_Harari "Yuval Noah Harari"), and [*Robert Greene*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Greene_(American_author) "Robert Greene").


### Who are you?
I'm 21 years old, living in India. I’m a design engineer, writer, and a student of computer science. 
Trying to Developing skill through doing, guiltlessly exploring passion and interests, imbuing quality. 
I enjoy deep, dark, boring dance music, that you can’t dance to. some of my favorite artists are [__*Jon Hopkins*__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Hopkins "Jon Hopkins"), [__*Four Tet*__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Tet "Four Tet"),


### What do you do?
I’m a software engineer, crafting interfaces at [devrev](https://devrev.ai).
I’m also a occasional writer, writing about design, development, and productivity on this [site](/).

### What led you into code?
I wanted to be able to create something that people could interact with, and that’s when I started learning to code. 
Web development was one of the few aspects of studying computer science that felt tangible – you could build real, beautiful products that people actually use. 
I needed a way to put ideas in your hands. Websites are that way.

### Where do you go to get inspired?
- __Book stores__, to browse cover designs. 
It’s fascinating to see several hundred pages of ideas condensed into a single visual. 
- I love __furniture__, the materiality of furniture is something I really miss in software. And I don’t mean skeuomorphism. 
I mean the way fabrics feel to the hand or how brass patina’s over time. The way color interacts with natural light throughout the day. 
Honestly, thinking through all this gets me depressed about software sometimes. 
- Well designed __buildings and museums__, for the architecture and framing. 
I know nothing about architecture, but being surrounded by beauty (not even the beauty you’re supposed to look at!) made me realize that *“everything around me is someone’s life work”*. 
- __iOS apps__ for micro-animations and interactions. 
- Type foundry websites for best-in-class web typography and layout. A walk. A shower.
